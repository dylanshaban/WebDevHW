There was a lot of good information in the article and I certainly have taken away some valuable things, but I partially disagree with one point in particular. The article did serve its purpose in bringing to my attention the things I hadn’t or maybe wouldn’t normally consider before making a wireframe. But I maintain that I work better when I sit down and just go, making adjustments and revisions as I work rather than making deliberate decisions from the get-go. You’ve got to swallow the frog so why not just do it right away. And omnigraffle is super expensive for a student like me so I don’t know what that’s about.
