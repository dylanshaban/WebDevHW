In a world...
I built the website in the manor I presented before the break. 
It starts out with terms and conditions made almost entierely out of parts of movie scripts, Wallace Shawn monologues
and a little bit of the big lebowski, and some bee movie thrown in there. Accept the conditions and you're taken to the quiz,
which is pretty much a joke. Some of the questions have no wrong answer and most are ridiculous. Hit the donezo button and 
your score pops up as how many times you've gotten the right answer, except it says 'seen the truth.' Then you can go to the
contact us page and be met with a fake email and fax number and a google map to nowhere, literally. There's a gallery, it's 
basically just mangery of the photos from the quiz. If you click on apparel it takes you to a link on amazon for an aluminum
foil hat.
